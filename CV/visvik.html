    <h1 class="visvik">VISVIK</h1>
    <p class="info5"> <strong>VISVIK</strong> is a game concept which I have created, but I have done only one itteration of it.</p>
    <p class="info5">The first itteration is a 2D 16-bit platformer with a Viking theme. </p>
    <p class="info5">The core gameplay is a souls-like. What that means it is a very hard but rewarding game. In-game deaths is part of the journey in the game. This style of games originated from the japanese game developers From Software, with their first game called Dark Souls, and since then has published over 9 titles, and their latest title was released in 2022 and it was called Elden Ring.</p>
    <p class="info5">I have a great love for these games, because I love a good and rewarding challenge in games and these games fulfill just that. </p>
    <p class="info5">During the last year in Gymnasium I had to decide what type of product I would develop, create and "sell". I have always been fond of games so I thought with the little knowledge I had back then to finally make a real game. </p>
    <p class="info5">So I decided to make a souls-like game, but with the little knowledge I had by making 2D pixels platformer games I decided to not go for something like 3D realistic type of game.</p>
    <p class="info5">It took some time do think of what to call the game, but I finally settled on VISVIK.</p>
    <p class="info5">VISVIK is a combined word of Viking and Vegvisir. Vegvisir is the "life-compass" in norse mythology and It shows you the path in life if you were to follow it. </p>
    
    <p class="info5">I also made the cover and a physical copy of the game.</p>
    <p class="info5">Someday in the future I will make the game how I always have envisioned it.</p>
    <p class="info5">Because this is something I have always dreamed of doing!</p>
